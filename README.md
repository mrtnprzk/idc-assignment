# Description

## Interview Task â€“ Data Visualization Engineer

### Process

The goal of the interview task is to gauge the candidate's problem solving and communication skills, and to hint on the kind of work the role will entail.
The interview task will be shared with the candidate in this form on an agreed date, and the candidate will return the outcome the following day.
We expect the candidate to spend 3-5 hours solving the task to the extent permitted by this time frame.

### Data

Use the https://metmuseum.github.io/ data set as the data source. 
Data is available via the documented API endpoints like https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/search?q=sunflowers or in a CSV format https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess.
You can extend this data set with other open sources, but that is not required.

### Problem

The data set describes individual pieces of art as well as the whole art collection. 
The information is rich and varied, containing textual, time-series, and connected data, and invites for further exploration.
The task for you is to consider the data set and imagine different questions one might have about the data. 
Using your preferred tools, try to discover interesting data stories and present them in your own visualizations.

### Outcome

Share your visualization outcomes in a form and format you arrive at. Send only PDF attachments by email, if any. 
Use a GitHub repository if we can see the implementation ourselves. Share a hyperlink to a running interactive visualization, if that is the case.
We will review the outcomes and decide about proceeding with the interview into the final round. 
On that session, you will have 10-15 minutes to present the visualization or do a live demo running on your local device.

Thank you for your effort!
